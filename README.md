- This file is designed to outline the steps to setting up the GitHub repo correctly for a React.js application
- There are a number of ways to push a local directory to a live GitHub repo: via CLI, via Desktop app or via Browser application

- **OUR CHOICE:** GitHub Desktop Application (for the timebeing)

### STEPS TO UPLOADING/PUSHING LOCAL DIRECTORY TO GITHUB REPOSITORY ("REPO")
  1. Create/use your local React.js application (npx create-react-app client)
  2. On GitHub Desktop, click "Add Exisiting Repository" and select your application file path
  3. It will prompt you to create a new repository in GitHub - do so
      -> By using this option, it ensures the file name & repo name match, preventing any duplicate folders being created
  4. Commit the changes to the main & check the GitHub repo to ensure your React.js application has been uploaded correctly

### STEPS TO CONTROLLING & UDPATING CONTENT:
  1. If you edit or update your local React.js project, you will need to commit the changes to your main repo via the Desktop app
  2. Check the repository in the browser to ensure the changes have been updated in the repo
